# Social-Media-Analysis-using-Python

With the goal to enhance my domain knowledge and practice my Python skills, I have chosen a very exciting project in the marketing domain. It's called "𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧".



In this analysis, I took 365 data science 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐧 data and performed various analyses. Firstly, I learned about the marketing basics like 𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐧, 𝐀𝐝, and 𝐀𝐝 𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐬. After that, I delved into the important metrics for campaign performance evaluation, including 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡, 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐂𝐓𝐑, 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐬, 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞, 𝐂𝐏𝐌, 𝐂𝐏𝐂, 𝐂𝐏𝐑, and 𝐑𝐎𝐀𝐒.



If you want to read about these topics, you can check the 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐭 I have shared below. 👇



Steps for the social media analysis include:



1. Examining the dataset

2. Understanding the overall campaign performance

3. Categorizing Ad Sets as 𝐇𝐨𝐭, 𝐖𝐚𝐫𝐦, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐝 and analyzing the performance of each category.

4. Further categorizing Ad Sets into 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 and 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 and analyzing their performance.



I'll be continuing further with the project, so stay tuned! 👍
